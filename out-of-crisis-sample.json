Further examples will appear in later chapters.\n\nSome folklore\nFolklore has it in America that quality and production are incompatible: that you cannot have both. A plant manager will usually tell you that it is either or. In his experience, if he pushes quality, he falls behind in production. If he pushes production, his quality suffers. This will be his experience when he knows not what quality is nor how to achieve it.1\nA clear, concise answer came forth in a meeting with 22 production workers, all union representatives, in response to my question: “Why is it that productivity increases as quality improves?”\nLess rework.\nThere is no better answer. Another version often comes forth:\nNot so much waste.\nQuality to the production worker means that his performance satisfies him, provides to him pride of workmanship.\nImprovement of quality transfers waste of man-hours and of machine-time into the manufacture of good product and better service. The result is a chain reaction—lower costs, better competitive position, happier people on the job, jobs, and more jobs.\nA clear statement of the relationship between quality and productivity comes from my friend Dr. Yoshikasu Tsuda of Rikkyo University in Tokyo, who wrote to me from San Francisco as follows, dated 23 March 1980:\n\nI have just spent a year in the northern hemisphere, in 23 countries, in which I visited many industrial plants, and talked with many industrialists.\nIn Europe and in America, people are now more interested in cost of quality and in systems of quality-audit. But in Japan, we are keeping very strong interest to improve quality by use of methods which you started. … when we improve quality we also improve productivity, just as you told us in 1950 would happen.\nDr. Tsuda is saying that Western industry is satisfied to improve quality to a level where visible figures may shed doubt about the economic benefit of further improvement. As someone enquired, “How low may we go in quality without losing customers?” This question packs a mountain of misunderstanding into a few choice words. It is typical of management’s misunderstanding in America. In contrast, the Japanese go right ahead and improve the process without regard to figures. They thus improve productivity, decrease costs, and capture the market.\n\nAwakening in Japan\nManagement in some companies in Japan observed in 1948 and 1949 that improvement of quality begets naturally and inevitably improvement of productivity. This observation came from the work of a number of Japanese engineers who studied literature on quality control supplied by engineers from the Bell Laboratories then working on General MacArthur’s staff. The literature included Walter A. Shewhart’s book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (Van Nostrand, 1931; repr. ed., American Society for Quality Control, 1980). The results were exciting, showing that productivity does indeed improve as variation is reduced, just as prophesied by the methods and logic of Shewhart’s book. As a result of a foreign expert’s visit in the summer of 1950, the following chain reaction became engraved in Japan as a way of life.2 This chain reaction was on the blackboard of every meeting with top management in Japan from July 1950 onward; also Figure 1.\n \n\nFigure 1 Production viewed as a system. Improvement of quality envelops the entire production line, from incoming materials to the consumer, and redesign of product and service for the future. This chart was first used in August 1950 at a conference with top management at the Hotel de Yama on Mount Hakone in Japan. In a service organization, the sources A, B, C, etc., could be sources of data, or work from preceding operations, such as charges (as in a department store), calculation of charges, deposits, withdrawals, inventories in and out, transcriptions, shipping orders, and the like.\nThe production worker in Japan, as anywhere else in the world, always knew about this chain reaction; also that defects and faults that get into the hands of the customer lose the market and cost him his job.\nOnce management in Japan adopted the chain reaction, everyone there from 1950 onward had one common aim, namely, quality.\nWith no lenders nor stockholders to press for dividends, this effort became an undivided bond between management and production workers. An unfriendly takeover or a leveraged buyout does not take place in Japan. Managers are not sensitive to the price:earnings ratio of their stock. The Japanese manager may adopt constancy of purpose (see Point 1 in Ch. 2, p. 21). (The quotations from articles by Tsurumi and Kaus on pp. 85, 86, and 124 are relevant here.)\n\nFlow diagram (Figure 1)\nMere talk about quality accomplishes little. It was necessary to go into action. The flow diagram in Figure 1 provided a start. Materials and equipment come in at the left. It would be necessary, I explained, to improve incoming materials. Work with your vendor as a partner on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust to improve the quality of incoming materials and to decrease costs.\nThe consumer is the most important part of the production line. Quality should be aimed at the needs of the consumer, present and future.\nQuality begins with the intent, which is fixed by management. The intent must be translated by engineers and others into plans, specifications, tests, production. The principles explained here, along with the chain reaction displayed on page 3, the flow diagram in Figure 1, and techniques taught to hundreds of engineers, commenced the transformation of Japanese industry (more in the Appendix). A new economic age had begun.\nManagement learned about their responsibilities for improvement at every stage. Engineers learned theirs, and learned simple but powerful statistical methods by which to detect the existence of special (assignable) causes of variation, and that continual improvement of processes is essential (Point 5, p. 22). Improvement of quality became at once, with total commitment:\nCompanywide—all plants, management, engineers, production workers, suppliers, everybody.\nNationwide.\nEmbracing every activity in production and service—procurement, design and redesign of product and service, instrumentation, production, consumer research.\n\nNeed any country be poor?\nJapan had in fact in 1950 negative net worth. Japan was, as now, devoid of natural resources—oil, coal, iron ore, copper, manganese, even wood. Moreover, Japan had a well-earned reputation for shoddy consumer goods, cheap but worth the price. Japan must export goods in return for food and equipment. This battle could be won only with quality. The consumer will from now on be the most important part of the production line (Figure 1). This was a difficult challenge for top management in Japan.\nIf Japan be an example, then it is possible that any country with enough people and with good management, making products suited to their talents and to the market, need not be poor. Abundance of natural resources is not a requirement for prosperity. The wealth of a nation depends on its people, management, and government, more than on its natural resources. The problem is where to find good management. It would be a mistake to export American management to a friendly country.\n\nWhat is the world’s most underdeveloped nation?\nWith the storehouse of skills and knowledge contained in its millions of unemployed, and with the even more appalling underuse, misuse, and abuse of skills and knowledge in the army of employed people in all ranks in all industries, the United States may be today the most underdeveloped nation in the world.\n\nReferences to government service\n\nIn most governmental services, there is no market to capture. In place of capture of the market, a governmental agency should deliver economically the service prescribed by law or regulation. The aim should be distinction in service. Continual improvement in government service would earn appreciation of the American public and would hold jobs in the service, and help industry to create more jobs.\n\nA simple example\nSome figures taken from experience will illustrate what happens when we improve quality. A schoolboy can understand them. The superintendent in a plant knew that there were problems with a certain production line. His only explanation was that the work force there (24 people) made a lot of mistakes: that if these people did not make mistakes, there would be none.\nThe first step was to get data from inspection and to plot the fraction defective day by day over the past six weeks (Figure 2). This plot (a run chart) showed stable random variation above and below the average. The level of mistakes, and the variation day to day, were accordingly predictable. What does this mean? It means that here is a stable system for production of defective items (Ch. 11). Any substantial improvement must come from action on the system, the responsibility of management. Wishing and pleading and begging the workers to do better was totally futile.\n\nFigure 2 Proportion defective day by day, before and after attempt to construct operational definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not. The proportion defective was 11 percent before, 5 percent after. I express here my indebtedness to David S. Chambers for the privilege to work with him on this example.\nWhat could the management do? The consultants made the suggestion, based on experience, that possibly the people on the job, and the inspector also, did not understand well enough what kind of work is acceptable and what is not. The manager and two supervisors eventually accepted this possibility and went to work on the matter. With trial and error they came up in seven weeks with operational definitions, with examples of conforming items and of nonconforming items, posted for everyone to see. A new set of data showed that the proportion defective had dropped to 5 percent, as shown in the accompanying table and in the right-hand half of Figure 2.\nIllustration of gain in productivity with improved quality\n\n\n\nItem\nBefore improvement(11% defective)\nAfter improvement(5% defective)\n\nTotal cost\n100\n100\n\nSpent to make good units\n89\n95\n\nSpent to make defective\n11\n5\nGains\nQuality up\nProduction of good product up 6 percent\nCapacity up 6 percent\nLower cost per unit of good product\nProfit improved\nCustomer happier\nEverybody happier\nThese gains were immediate (seven weeks); cost, zero; same work force, same burden, no investment in new machinery.\nThis is an example of gain in productivity accomplished by a change in the system, namely, improvement in definitions, effected by the management, to help people to work smarter, not harder.\nIt could well be that another factor entered, unseen. It could be that the foreman on days when he was pressed for production had accepted poor work to meet his quota, overriding inspection and confusing workers and inspectors concerning what was acceptable work and what was not.\nNext step: wipe out the 5 percent defective. How? First, we note that again the daily points show stable variation about the new average 5 percent; hence, again, any substantial improvement must come from action on the system. Here are some suggestions to investigate:\nIncoming materials difficult to work with.\nSome machines not working properly.\nThere may still be some difficulty in the definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not.\n\nIt might be wise to keep a record for two weeks in the form of a chart for fraction defective for each operator. Calculations might show that one or two of them are out of control with respect to the others. If so, make tests to learn whether further training could help them, or whether they should be moved into other jobs (Ch. 8). Look carefully at the incoming materials. Are they causing trouble? How about maintenance of machines?\nThere were 24 people on the line. The inspector would take a case of items as it went by her, inspect them, and record the results, then intercept another case for inspection. “What do you do with the tickets you fill out?” Answer: “I put them on the pile here, and when the pile gets too high, I discard the bottom half into the trash.”\n“Could I have the top half?” I asked her. She was delighted.\nWe took the top half, which gave us the tickets for the most recent six weeks, which gave us the points on the left half of Figure 2.\n\nAnother example: reduction in cost.\nTaken from a speech delivered in Rio de Janeiro, March 1981, by William E. Conway, president of the Nashua Corporation:\n\nAt Nashua, the first big success took place in March 1980; improvement of quality and reduction of cost in the manufacture of carbonless paper.\nWater-based coating that contains various chemicals is applied to a moving web of paper. If the amount of coating is right, the customer will be pleased with a good consistent mark when he uses the paper some months later. The coating head applied approximately 3.6 pounds of dry coating to 3000 square feet of paper at a speed of approximately 1100 linear feet per minute on a web 6 or 8 feet wide. Technicians took samples of paper and made tests to determine the intensity of the mark. These tests were made on the sample both as it came off the coater and after it was aged in an oven to simulate use by the customer. When tests showed the intensity of the mark to be too low or too high, the operator made adjustments that would increase or decrease the amount of coating material. Frequent stops for new settings were a way of life. These stops were costly.\nThe engineers knew that the average weight of the coating material was too high, but did not know how to lower it without risk of putting on insufficient coating. A new coating head, to cost $700,000, was under consideration. There would be, besides the cost of $700,000, time lost for installation, and the risk that the new head might not achieve uniformity and economy of coating much better than the equipment in use.\nIn August 1979, the plant manager asked for help. It was found that the coating head, if left untouched, was actually in pretty good statistical control at an average level of 3.6 dry pounds of coating on the paper, plus or minus 0.4.\nElimination of various causes of variation, highlighted by points outside the control limits, reduced the amount of coating and still maintained good consistent quality. The coater had by April 1980 settled down to an average of 2.8 pounds per 3000 square feet, varying from 2.4 to 3.2, thereby saving 0.8 pound per 3000 square feet (3.6–2.8), or $800,000 per year at present volume and cost levels.\n\nIt may be noted that what the people there had been doing was to follow Rule 2 or Rule 3 (p. 282), greatly increasing the variance of the coating, exactly the opposite of what they were trying to do.\n\nInnovation to improve the process\n The rest of Mr. Conway’s story is still more interesting. Statistical control opened the way to engineering innovation. Without statistical control, the process was in unstable chaos, the noise of which would mask the effect of any attempt to bring improvement. With statistical control achieved, engineers and chemists became innovative, creative. They now had an identifiable process. They modified the chemical content of the material used for the coating and found how to use less and less. Reduction of a tenth of a pound means an annual reduction of $100,000 in the cost of coating.\nThe engineers also improved the coating head, to achieve greater and greater uniformity of coating. All the while, statistical control of the coating was maintained at ever-decreasing levels of coating, and with less and less variation.\n\nLow quality means high costs\n A plant was plagued by a huge amount of defective product. “How many people have you on this line for rework of defects made in previous operations?” I asked the manager. He went to the blackboard and put down three people here, four there, and so on—in total, 21 percent of the work force on the line.\nDefects are not free. Somebody makes them, and gets paid for making them. On the supposition that it costs as much to correct a defect as to make it in the first place, then 42 percent of his payroll and burden was being spent to make defective items and to repair them.\nOnce the manager saw the magnitude of the problem, and saw that he was paying out good money to make defects as well as to correct them, he found ways to improve processes and to help the people on the line to understand better the new operation. The cost of rework went down dramatically in a space of two months.\nNext step: reduce further the proportion defective in a never-ending program of improvement. The cost of rework is only part of the cost of poor quality. Poor quality begets poor quality and lowers productivity all along the line, and some of the faulty product goes out the door, into the hands of the customer. An unhappy customer tells his friends. The multiplying effect of an unhappy customer is one of those unknown and unknowable figures, and likewise for the multiplying effect of a happy customer, who brings in business (see p. 104).\nA. V. Feigenbaum estimated that from 15 to 40 percent of the manufacturer’s costs of almost any American product that you buy today is for waste embedded in it—waste of human effort, waste of machine-time, nonproductive use of accompanying burden.3 No wonder that many American products are hard to sell at home or abroad.\nIn some work that I did for a railway, study showed that mechanics in a huge repair shop spent three-quarters of their time waiting in line to get parts.\nThe reader’s own estimate of the cost of common practices in the United States, such as awarding business to the lowest bidder and robbing people of their right to pride of workmanship (Points 4 and 12 in Ch. 2), would add a deplorable amount to Dr. Feigenbaum’s estimate.\nHandling damage, right in the factory, is in many places appalling, sometimes running from 5 to 8 percent of the manufacturer’s cost. Further loss occurs in transit. Then there is shelf-wear—further loss. Ask any grocer what his losses are from handling damage on his platform, platform to storage shelf, shelf-wear, mauling by curious customers.\n\nNew machinery and gadgets are not the answer\nWe have just seen an example in which important gains in quality and productivity were accomplished by learning to use effectively the machinery on hand.\nLag in American productivity has been attributed in editorials and in letters in the newspapers to failure to install new machinery, gadgets, and the latest types of automation such as robots. Such suggestions make interesting reading and still more interesting writing for people that do not understand problems of production. The following paragraph received from a friend in a large manufacturing company will serve as illustration:\n\nThis whole program [design and installation of new machines] has led to some unhappy experiences. All these wonderful machines performed their intended functions, on test, but when they were put into operation in our plants, with our people, they were out of business so much of the time for this and that kind of failure that our overall costs, instead of going down, went up. No one had evaluated the overall probable failure rates and maintenance. As a result, we were continually caught with stoppages and with not enough spare parts, or with none at all; and no provision for alternate production lines.\nGadgets for automation and automatic recording in the office and in the factory are not the answer either. Exhibitions featuring such gadgets are attended by thousands of people seeking an easy way out of the lag in productivity, trusting hopefully to hardware. Some gadgets may increase productivity enough to pay their own expenses, but the combined effect of new machinery, gadgets, and bright ideas is a small packet compared with the gains in productivity that will be accomplished by the management of companies that survive the decline (Chs. 2 and 3).\nIf I were a banker, I would not lend money for new equipment unless the company that asked for the loan could demonstrate by statistical evidence that they are using their present equipment to reasonably full capacity, and are at work on the 14 points of Chapter 2 and on the deadly diseases and obstacles of Chapter 3.\n\nService industries\n Eventually quality improvement will reach not only the production of goods and food (the birthplace of modern statistical theory was agriculture) but the service industries as well—hotels, restaurants, transportation of freight and passengers, wholesale and retail establishments, hospitals, medical service, care of the aged, perhaps even the U.S. mail.\nIn fact, one of the most successful examples of improvement of quality and productivity in large operations is in our own Census, not only in the decennial Census, but also in the regular monthly and quarterly surveys of people and of business, an example being the Monthly Report on the Labor Force.\nChapter 7 contains a number of examples of improvement of practices in service industries. The section written by William J. Latzko describes methods and results in reduction of errors in a bank. The section written by John F. Hird describes improvements in the purchase, generation, and distribution of electric power to customers, which is one of the most important services of the country. A large power company in the United States, under his guidance, is improving service and cutting costs, with substantial profit, no one working harder, only smarter, from management to linemen and truck drivers (p. 204). (Cf. William G. Hunter, pp. 210ff.)\nSome service industries in Japan have been active in improvement of productivity from the start in 1950—for example, the Japanese National Railways, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, the Tobacco Monopoly of Japan, the Post Office.\nService organizations have won the Deming Prize in Japan; for example, Takenaka Komuten, an architectural and construction firm, won the Deming Prize in 1979. They studied the needs of users (in offices, hospitals, factories, hotels, trains, subways). They reduced by computer the amount and cost of rework in drawings. Research in soils, rocks, movement of earth, machinery, accomplished continual improvement in methods of construction. Kajima Corporation, another architectural and construction firm, won similar recognition in 1982; likewise the Shimizu Construction Company, in 1983. The Kansai Electric Power Company, serving Osaka, Nagoya, and other parts of Central Japan, the biggest power company in the world, won the Deming Prize in 1984.\n\nMeasures of productivity do not lead to improvement in productivity.\nThere is in the United States, any day, a conference on productivity, usually more than one. There is in fact a permanent conference on productivity, and there is now the President’s Committee on Productivity. The aim of these conferences is to construct measures of productivity. It is important to have measures of productivity for meaningful comparisons of productivity in the United States year by year, and for meaningful comparisons between countries. Unfortunately, however, figures on productivity in the United States do not help to improve productivity in the United States. Measures of productivity are like statistics on accidents: they tell you all about the number of accidents in the home, on the road, and at the work place, but they do not tell you how to reduce the frequency of accidents.\nIt is unfortunately to be feared that quality assurance means in many places a deluge of figures that tell how many defective items of this type and that type were produced last month, with comparisons month to month and year to year. Figures like this tell the management how things have been going, but they do not point the way to improvement.\nOne of the lecturers at the meeting of the Bank Administration Institute held in Atlanta in January 1982 advised every bank to establish a productivity office to measure productivity. There are 14,000 banks in the United States. The speaker’s plan would thus create 14,000 jobs. Unfortunately, measurement of productivity does not improve productivity.\nOn the other hand, an orderly study of productivity, to enquire whether any given activity is consistent with the aim of the organization, and what it is costing, can be very helpful to the management. The following paragraphs from Marvin E. Mundel, Measuring and Enhancing the Productivity of Service and Government Organizations (Asian Productivity Organization, Aoyama Pai-ichi Mansions, 4–14 Akasaka 8-chome, Minatoku, Tokyo 107, 1975, pp. 3–4) throw light on this point:\n\nOutputs … cannot be considered without considering the goals they are designed to achieve. …\nIn order to provide some background let us analyze a few examples. Thomas A. Edison, the great American inventor, is said to have proposed a voting machine to improve the voting procedure used by the Congress of the United States. He demonstrated his device to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. With his device each Representative and Senator would have had three buttons on the arm of his chair; a red button for no, a green button for yes and a white button for abstain. Edison proposed that, when the signal to vote was given, each Member would push the appropriate button and both a record of how each voted and the totals of the votes would be displayed instantly. Edison proudly assured the Speaker and the President of the Senate that his device would eliminate roll-call errors, reduce the time for a roll-call vote by an enormous percentage, and so forth.\nHe was utterly astounded when the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate cut him off brusquely and informed him that such a system was utterly unwanted, undesirable and, rather than improving the operation of the House or the Senate, would completely upset the orderly working of the Congress of the United States. What was an improvement from Edison’s point of view was anything but an improvement from the viewpoint of the Congress. The delays in a roll-call vote were an integral part of the deliberative process with which the Congress had chosen to operate. Mr. Edison’s output, a faster vote, was not compatible with the objectives of the Congress.\nAs an example from the private sector, a large shipbuilding firm sought to improve the performance of the group charged with planning and implementing the shiplaunching ceremony party. Initial efforts were directed at the equipment used to send invitations, and so forth. However, questions were raised concerning possible confusion between the party given (the output) and the purpose of the party (the objective).\nThe objective of the party planning group was to improve relations with vendors and government officials of the area. When the output (the party) was initiated it had served this purpose. However, when the frequency changed from one-per-year to almost monthly the parties no longer achieved this purpose; they had become a bore and an imposition.\nRather than improve the method of planning and implementing, the format of the party was changed to include only a small, interested group; the owner, his guests and hosts from the company. Twenty employees in the party-giving group were made available for other work. Other additional savings (temporary seat erecting labor; loss of shipway time) were almost as large. Public relations were improved.\n\nNotes\n1. Taken from the letter from Dr. Tsuda referred to below.\n2. I am indebted to founding members of JUSE for the early history of their efforts: in particular, Dr. E.

It would be a mistake to export American management to a friendly country.\n\nWhat is the world’s most underdeveloped nation?\nWith the storehouse of skills and knowledge contained in its millions of unemployed, and with the even more appalling underuse, misuse, and abuse of skills and knowledge in the army of employed people in all ranks in all industries, the United States may be today the most underdeveloped nation in the world.\n\nReferences to government service\n\nIn most governmental services, there is no market to capture. In place of capture of the market, a governmental agency should deliver economically the service prescribed by law or regulation. The aim should be distinction in service. Continual improvement in government service would earn appreciation of the American public and would hold jobs in the service, and help industry to create more jobs.\n\nA simple example\nSome figures taken from experience will illustrate what happens when we improve quality. A schoolboy can understand them. The superintendent in a plant knew that there were problems with a certain production line. His only explanation was that the work force there (24 people) made a lot of mistakes: that if these people did not make mistakes, there would be none.\nThe first step was to get data from inspection and to plot the fraction defective day by day over the past six weeks (Figure 2). This plot (a run chart) showed stable random variation above and below the average. The level of mistakes, and the variation day to day, were accordingly predictable. What does this mean? It means that here is a stable system for production of defective items (Ch. 11). Any substantial improvement must come from action on the system, the responsibility of management. Wishing and pleading and begging the workers to do better was totally futile.\n\nFigure 2 Proportion defective day by day, before and after attempt to construct operational definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not. The proportion defective was 11 percent before, 5 percent after. I express here my indebtedness to David S. Chambers for the privilege to work with him on this example.\nWhat could the management do? The consultants made the suggestion, based on experience, that possibly the people on the job, and the inspector also, did not understand well enough what kind of work is acceptable and what is not. The manager and two supervisors eventually accepted this possibility and went to work on the matter. With trial and error they came up in seven weeks with operational definitions, with examples of conforming items and of nonconforming items, posted for everyone to see. A new set of data showed that the proportion defective had dropped to 5 percent, as shown in the accompanying table and in the right-hand half of Figure 2.\nIllustration of gain in productivity with improved quality\n\n\n\nItem\nBefore improvement(11% defective)\nAfter improvement(5% defective)\n\nTotal cost\n100\n100\n\nSpent to make good units\n89\n95\n\nSpent to make defective\n11\n5\nGains\nQuality up\nProduction of good product up 6 percent\nCapacity up 6 percent\nLower cost per unit of good product\nProfit improved\nCustomer happier\nEverybody happier\nThese gains were immediate (seven weeks); cost, zero; same work force, same burden, no investment in new machinery.\nThis is an example of gain in productivity accomplished by a change in the system, namely, improvement in definitions, effected by the management, to help people to work smarter, not harder.\nIt could well be that another factor entered, unseen. It could be that the foreman on days when he was pressed for production had accepted poor work to meet his quota, overriding inspection and confusing workers and inspectors concerning what was acceptable work and what was not.\nNext step: wipe out the 5 percent defective. How? First, we note that again the daily points show stable variation about the new average 5 percent; hence, again, any substantial improvement must come from action on the system. Here are some suggestions to investigate:\nIncoming materials difficult to work with.\nSome machines not working properly.\nThere may still be some difficulty in the definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not.\n\nIt might be wise to keep a record for two weeks in the form of a chart for fraction defective for each operator. Calculations might show that one or two of them are out of control with respect to the others. If so, make tests to learn whether further training could help them, or whether they should be moved into other jobs (Ch. 8). Look carefully at the incoming materials. Are they causing trouble? How about maintenance of machines?\nThere were 24 people on the line. The inspector would take a case of items as it went by her, inspect them, and record the results, then intercept another case for inspection. “What do you do with the tickets you fill out?” Answer: “I put them on the pile here, and when the pile gets too high, I discard the bottom half into the trash.”\n“Could I have the top half?” I asked her. She was delighted.\nWe took the top half, which gave us the tickets for the most recent six weeks, which gave us the points on the left half of Figure 2.\n\nAnother example: reduction in cost.\nTaken from a speech delivered in Rio de Janeiro, March 1981, by William E. Conway, president of the Nashua Corporation:\n\nAt Nashua, the first big success took place in March 1980; improvement of quality and reduction of cost in the manufacture of carbonless paper.\nWater-based coating that contains various chemicals is applied to a moving web of paper. If the amount of coating is right, the customer will be pleased with a good consistent mark when he uses the paper some months later. The coating head applied approximately 3.6 pounds of dry coating to 3000 square feet of paper at a speed of approximately 1100 linear feet per minute on a web 6 or 8 feet wide. Technicians took samples of paper and made tests to determine the intensity of the mark. These tests were made on the sample both as it came off the coater and after it was aged in an oven to simulate use by the customer. When tests showed the intensity of the mark to be too low or too high, the operator made adjustments that would increase or decrease the amount of coating material. Frequent stops for new settings were a way of life. These stops were costly.\nThe engineers knew that the average weight of the coating material was too high, but did not know how to lower it without risk of putting on insufficient coating. A new coating head, to cost $700,000, was under consideration. There would be, besides the cost of $700,000, time lost for installation, and the risk that the new head might not achieve uniformity and economy of coating much better than the equipment in use.\nIn August 1979, the plant manager asked for help. It was found that the coating head, if left untouched, was actually in pretty good statistical control at an average level of 3.6 dry pounds of coating on the paper, plus or minus 0.4.\nElimination of various causes of variation, highlighted by points outside the control limits, reduced the amount of coating and still maintained good consistent quality. The coater had by April 1980 settled down to an average of 2.8 pounds per 3000 square feet, varying from 2.4 to 3.2, thereby saving 0.8 pound per 3000 square feet (3.6–2.8), or $800,000 per year at present volume and cost levels.\n\nIt may be noted that what the people there had been doing was to follow Rule 2 or Rule 3 (p. 282), greatly increasing the variance of the coating, exactly the opposite of what they were trying to do.\n\nInnovation to improve the process\n The rest of Mr. Conway’s story is still more interesting. Statistical control opened the way to engineering innovation. Without statistical control, the process was in unstable chaos, the noise of which would mask the effect of any attempt to bring improvement. With statistical control achieved, engineers and chemists became innovative, creative. They now had an identifiable process. They modified the chemical content of the material used for the coating and found how to use less and less. Reduction of a tenth of a pound means an annual reduction of $100,000 in the cost of coating.\nThe engineers also improved the coating head, to achieve greater and greater uniformity of coating. All the while, statistical control of the coating was maintained at ever-decreasing levels of coating, and with less and less variation.\n\nLow quality means high costs\n A plant was plagued by a huge amount of defective product. “How many people have you on this line for rework of defects made in previous operations?” I asked the manager. He went to the blackboard and put down three people here, four there, and so on—in total, 21 percent of the work force on the line.\nDefects are not free. Somebody makes them, and gets paid for making them. On the supposition that it costs as much to correct a defect as to make it in the first place, then 42 percent of his payroll and burden was being spent to make defective items and to repair them.\nOnce the manager saw the magnitude of the problem, and saw that he was paying out good money to make defects as well as to correct them, he found ways to improve processes and to help the people on the line to understand better the new operation. The cost of rework went down dramatically in a space of two months.\nNext step: reduce further the proportion defective in a never-ending program of improvement. The cost of rework is only part of the cost of poor quality. Poor quality begets poor quality and lowers productivity all along the line, and some of the faulty product goes out the door, into the hands of the customer. An unhappy customer tells his friends. The multiplying effect of an unhappy customer is one of those unknown and unknowable figures, and likewise for the multiplying effect of a happy customer, who brings in business (see p. 104).\nA. V. Feigenbaum estimated that from 15 to 40 percent of the manufacturer’s costs of almost any American product that you buy today is for waste embedded in it—waste of human effort, waste of machine-time, nonproductive use of accompanying burden.3 No wonder that many American products are hard to sell at home or abroad.\nIn some work that I did for a railway, study showed that mechanics in a huge repair shop spent three-quarters of their time waiting in line to get parts.\nThe reader’s own estimate of the cost of common practices in the United States, such as awarding business to the lowest bidder and robbing people of their right to pride of workmanship (Points 4 and 12 in Ch. 2), would add a deplorable amount to Dr. Feigenbaum’s estimate.\nHandling damage, right in the factory, is in many places appalling, sometimes running from 5 to 8 percent of the manufacturer’s cost. Further loss occurs in transit. Then there is shelf-wear—further loss. Ask any grocer what his losses are from handling damage on his platform, platform to storage shelf, shelf-wear, mauling by curious customers.\n\nNew machinery and gadgets are not the answer\nWe have just seen an example in which important gains in quality and productivity were accomplished by learning to use effectively the machinery on hand.\nLag in American productivity has been attributed in editorials and in letters in the newspapers to failure to install new machinery, gadgets, and the latest types of automation such as robots. Such suggestions make interesting reading and still more interesting writing for people that do not understand problems of production. The following paragraph received from a friend in a large manufacturing company will serve as illustration:\n\nThis whole program [design and installation of new machines] has led to some unhappy experiences. All these wonderful machines performed their intended functions, on test, but when they were put into operation in our plants, with our people, they were out of business so much of the time for this and that kind of failure that our overall costs, instead of going down, went up. No one had evaluated the overall probable failure rates and maintenance. As a result, we were continually caught with stoppages and with not enough spare parts, or with none at all; and no provision for alternate production lines.\nGadgets for automation and automatic recording in the office and in the factory are not the answer either. Exhibitions featuring such gadgets are attended by thousands of people seeking an easy way out of the lag in productivity, trusting hopefully to hardware. Some gadgets may increase productivity enough to pay their own expenses, but the combined effect of new machinery, gadgets, and bright ideas is a small packet compared with the gains in productivity that will be accomplished by the management of companies that survive the decline (Chs. 2 and 3).\nIf I were a banker, I would not lend money for new equipment unless the company that asked for the loan could demonstrate by statistical evidence that they are using their present equipment to reasonably full capacity, and are at work on the 14 points of Chapter 2 and on the deadly diseases and obstacles of Chapter 3.\n\nService industries\n Eventually quality improvement will reach not only the production of goods and food (the birthplace of modern statistical theory was agriculture) but the service industries as well—hotels, restaurants, transportation of freight and passengers, wholesale and retail establishments, hospitals, medical service, care of the aged, perhaps even the U.S. mail.\nIn fact, one of the most successful examples of improvement of quality and productivity in large operations is in our own Census, not only in the decennial Census, but also in the regular monthly and quarterly surveys of people and of business, an example being the Monthly Report on the Labor Force.\nChapter 7 contains a number of examples of improvement of practices in service industries. The section written by William J. Latzko describes methods and results in reduction of errors in a bank. The section written by John F. Hird describes improvements in the purchase, generation, and distribution of electric power to customers, which is one of the most important services of the country. A large power company in the United States, under his guidance, is improving service and cutting costs, with substantial profit, no one working harder, only smarter, from management to linemen and truck drivers (p. 204). (Cf. William G. Hunter, pp. 210ff.)\nSome service industries in Japan have been active in improvement of productivity from the start in 1950—for example, the Japanese National Railways, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, the Tobacco Monopoly of Japan, the Post Office.\nService organizations have won the Deming Prize in Japan; for example, Takenaka Komuten, an architectural and construction firm, won the Deming Prize in 1979. They studied the needs of users (in offices, hospitals, factories, hotels, trains, subways). They reduced by computer the amount and cost of rework in drawings. Research in soils, rocks, movement of earth, machinery, accomplished continual improvement in methods of construction. Kajima Corporation, another architectural and construction firm, won similar recognition in 1982; likewise the Shimizu Construction Company, in 1983. The Kansai Electric Power Company, serving Osaka, Nagoya, and other parts of Central Japan, the biggest power company in the world, won the Deming Prize in 1984.\n\nMeasures of productivity do not lead to improvement in productivity.\nThere is in the United States, any day, a conference on productivity, usually more than one. There is in fact a permanent conference on productivity, and there is now the President’s Committee on Productivity. The aim of these conferences is to construct measures of productivity. It is important to have measures of productivity for meaningful comparisons of productivity in the United States year by year, and for meaningful comparisons between countries. Unfortunately, however, figures on productivity in the United States do not help to improve productivity in the United States. Measures of productivity are like statistics on accidents: they tell you all about the number of accidents in the home, on the road, and at the work place, but they do not tell you how to reduce the frequency of accidents.\nIt is unfortunately to be feared that quality assurance means in many places a deluge of figures that tell how many defective items of this type and that type were produced last month, with comparisons month to month and year to year. Figures like this tell the management how things have been going, but they do not point the way to improvement.\nOne of the lecturers at the meeting of the Bank Administration Institute held in Atlanta in January 1982 advised every bank to establish a productivity office to measure productivity. There are 14,000 banks in the United States. The speaker’s plan would thus create 14,000 jobs. Unfortunately, measurement of productivity does not improve productivity.\nOn the other hand, an orderly study of productivity, to enquire whether any given activity is consistent with the aim of the organization, and what it is costing, can be very helpful to the management. The following paragraphs from Marvin E. Mundel, Measuring and Enhancing the Productivity of Service and Government Organizations (Asian Productivity Organization, Aoyama Pai-ichi Mansions, 4–14 Akasaka 8-chome, Minatoku, Tokyo 107, 1975, pp. 3–4) throw light on this point:\n\nOutputs … cannot be considered without considering the goals they are designed to achieve. …\nIn order to provide some background let us analyze a few examples. Thomas A. Edison, the great American inventor, is said to have proposed a voting machine to improve the voting procedure used by the Congress of the United States. He demonstrated his device to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. With his device each Representative and Senator would have had three buttons on the arm of his chair; a red button for no, a green button for yes and a white button for abstain. Edison proposed that, when the signal to vote was given, each Member would push the appropriate button and both a record of how each voted and the totals of the votes would be displayed instantly. Edison proudly assured the Speaker and the President of the Senate that his device would eliminate roll-call errors, reduce the time for a roll-call vote by an enormous percentage, and so forth.\nHe was utterly astounded when the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate cut him off brusquely and informed him that such a system was utterly unwanted, undesirable and, rather than improving the operation of the House or the Senate, would completely upset the orderly working of the Congress of the United States. What was an improvement from Edison’s point of view was anything but an improvement from the viewpoint of the Congress. The delays in a roll-call vote were an integral part of the deliberative process with which the Congress had chosen to operate. Mr. Edison’s output, a faster vote, was not compatible with the objectives of the Congress.\nAs an example from the private sector, a large shipbuilding firm sought to improve the performance of the group charged with planning and implementing the shiplaunching ceremony party. Initial efforts were directed at the equipment used to send invitations, and so forth. However, questions were raised concerning possible confusion between the party given (the output) and the purpose of the party (the objective).\nThe objective of the party planning group was to improve relations with vendors and government officials of the area. When the output (the party) was initiated it had served this purpose. However, when the frequency changed from one-per-year to almost monthly the parties no longer achieved this purpose; they had become a bore and an imposition.\nRather than improve the method of planning and implementing, the format of the party was changed to include only a small, interested group; the owner, his guests and hosts from the company. Twenty employees in the party-giving group were made available for other work. Other additional savings (temporary seat erecting labor; loss of shipway time) were almost as large. Public relations were improved.\n\nNotes\n1. Taken from the letter from Dr. Tsuda referred to below.\n2. I am indebted to founding members of JUSE for the early history of their efforts: in particular, Dr. E. E. Nishibori. Work with a number of men in top management in Japan in 1950 and onward provided further help on history.

Feigenbaum. “Quality and productivity,” Quality Progress, November 1977. 1 Chain Reaction: Quality, Productivity, Lower Costs, Capture the Market\n\nWho is it that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?\n—Job 38: 2.\n\nAim of this chapter\nThe aim of this chapter is to illustrate a stable system of trouble in a manufacturing plant, and to explain that because the system is stable, improvement of quality is the responsibility of the management. Further examples will appear in later chapters.\n\nSome folklore\nFolklore has it in America that quality and production are incompatible: that you cannot have both. A plant manager will usually tell you that it is either or. In his experience, if he pushes quality, he falls behind in production. If he pushes production, his quality suffers. This will be his experience when he knows not what quality is nor how to achieve it.1\nA clear, concise answer came forth in a meeting with 22 production workers, all union representatives, in response to my question: “Why is it that productivity increases as quality improves?”\nLess rework.\nThere is no better answer. Another version often comes forth:\nNot so much waste.\nQuality to the production worker means that his performance satisfies him, provides to him pride of workmanship.\nImprovement of quality transfers waste of man-hours and of machine-time into the manufacture of good product and better service. The result is a chain reaction—lower costs, better competitive position, happier people on the job, jobs, and more jobs.\nA clear statement of the relationship between quality and productivity comes from my friend Dr. Yoshikasu Tsuda of Rikkyo University in Tokyo, who wrote to me from San Francisco as follows, dated 23 March 1980:\n\nI have just spent a year in the northern hemisphere, in 23 countries, in which I visited many industrial plants, and talked with many industrialists.\nIn Europe and in America, people are now more interested in cost of quality and in systems of quality-audit. But in Japan, we are keeping very strong interest to improve quality by use of methods which you started. … when we improve quality we also improve productivity, just as you told us in 1950 would happen.\nDr. Tsuda is saying that Western industry is satisfied to improve quality to a level where visible figures may shed doubt about the economic benefit of further improvement. As someone enquired, “How low may we go in quality without losing customers?” This question packs a mountain of misunderstanding into a few choice words. It is typical of management’s misunderstanding in America. In contrast, the Japanese go right ahead and improve the process without regard to figures. They thus improve productivity, decrease costs, and capture the market.\n\nAwakening in Japan\nManagement in some companies in Japan observed in 1948 and 1949 that improvement of quality begets naturally and inevitably improvement of productivity. This observation came from the work of a number of Japanese engineers who studied literature on quality control supplied by engineers from the Bell Laboratories then working on General MacArthur’s staff. The literature included Walter A. Shewhart’s book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (Van Nostrand, 1931; repr. ed., American Society for Quality Control, 1980). The results were exciting, showing that productivity does indeed improve as variation is reduced, just as prophesied by the methods and logic of Shewhart’s book. As a result of a foreign expert’s visit in the summer of 1950, the following chain reaction became engraved in Japan as a way of life.2 This chain reaction was on the blackboard of every meeting with top management in Japan from July 1950 onward; also Figure 1.\n \n\nFigure 1 Production viewed as a system. Improvement of quality envelops the entire production line, from incoming materials to the consumer, and redesign of product and service for the future. This chart was first used in August 1950 at a conference with top management at the Hotel de Yama on Mount Hakone in Japan. In a service organization, the sources A, B, C, etc., could be sources of data, or work from preceding operations, such as charges (as in a department store), calculation of charges, deposits, withdrawals, inventories in and out, transcriptions, shipping orders, and the like.\nThe production worker in Japan, as anywhere else in the world, always knew about this chain reaction; also that defects and faults that get into the hands of the customer lose the market and cost him his job.\nOnce management in Japan adopted the chain reaction, everyone there from 1950 onward had one common aim, namely, quality.\nWith no lenders nor stockholders to press for dividends, this effort became an undivided bond between management and production workers. An unfriendly takeover or a leveraged buyout does not take place in Japan. Managers are not sensitive to the price:earnings ratio of their stock. The Japanese manager may adopt constancy of purpose (see Point 1 in Ch. 2, p. 21). (The quotations from articles by Tsurumi and Kaus on pp. 85, 86, and 124 are relevant here.)\n\nFlow diagram (Figure 1)\nMere talk about quality accomplishes little. It was necessary to go into action. The flow diagram in Figure 1 provided a start. Materials and equipment come in at the left. It would be necessary, I explained, to improve incoming materials. Work with your vendor as a partner on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust to improve the quality of incoming materials and to decrease costs.\nThe consumer is the most important part of the production line. Quality should be aimed at the needs of the consumer, present and future.\nQuality begins with the intent, which is fixed by management. The intent must be translated by engineers and others into plans, specifications, tests, production. The principles explained here, along with the chain reaction displayed on page 3, the flow diagram in Figure 1, and techniques taught to hundreds of engineers, commenced the transformation of Japanese industry (more in the Appendix). A new economic age had begun.\nManagement learned about their responsibilities for improvement at every stage. Engineers learned theirs, and learned simple but powerful statistical methods by which to detect the existence of special (assignable) causes of variation, and that continual improvement of processes is essential (Point 5, p. 22). Improvement of quality became at once, with total commitment:\nCompanywide—all plants, management, engineers, production workers, suppliers, everybody.\nNationwide.\nEmbracing every activity in production and service—procurement, design and redesign of product and service, instrumentation, production, consumer research.\n\nNeed any country be poor?\nJapan had in fact in 1950 negative net worth. Japan was, as now, devoid of natural resources—oil, coal, iron ore, copper, manganese, even wood. Moreover, Japan had a well-earned reputation for shoddy consumer goods, cheap but worth the price. Japan must export goods in return for food and equipment. This battle could be won only with quality. The consumer will from now on be the most important part of the production line (Figure 1). This was a difficult challenge for top management in Japan.\nIf Japan be an example, then it is possible that any country with enough people and with good management, making products suited to their talents and to the market, need not be poor. Abundance of natural resources is not a requirement for prosperity. The wealth of a nation depends on its people, management, and government, more than on its natural resources. The problem is where to find good management. It would be a mistake to export American management to a friendly country.\n\nWhat is the world’s most underdeveloped nation?\nWith the storehouse of skills and knowledge contained in its millions of unemployed, and with the even more appalling underuse, misuse, and abuse of skills and knowledge in the army of employed people in all ranks in all industries, the United States may be today the most underdeveloped nation in the world.\n\nReferences to government service\n\nIn most governmental services, there is no market to capture. In place of capture of the market, a governmental agency should deliver economically the service prescribed by law or regulation. The aim should be distinction in service. Continual improvement in government service would earn appreciation of the American public and would hold jobs in the service, and help industry to create more jobs.\n\nA simple example\nSome figures taken from experience will illustrate what happens when we improve quality. A schoolboy can understand them. The superintendent in a plant knew that there were problems with a certain production line.

It means that here is a stable system for production of defective items (Ch. 11). Any substantial improvement must come from action on the system, the responsibility of management. Wishing and pleading and begging the workers to do better was totally futile.\n\nFigure 2 Proportion defective day by day, before and after attempt to construct operational definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not.

Statistical control opened the way to engineering innovation. Without statistical control, the process was in unstable chaos, the noise of which would mask the effect of any attempt to bring improvement. With statistical control achieved, engineers and chemists became innovative, creative. They now had an identifiable process. They modified the chemical content of the material used for the coating and found how to use less and less. Reduction of a tenth of a pound means an annual reduction of $100,000 in the cost of coating.\nThe engineers also improved the coating head, to achieve greater and greater uniformity of coating. All the while, statistical control of the coating was maintained at ever-decreasing levels of coating, and with less and less variation.\n\nLow quality means high costs\n A plant was plagued by a huge amount of defective product. “How many people have you on this line for rework of defects made in previous operations?” I asked the manager. He went to the blackboard and put down three people here, four there, and so on—in total, 21 percent of the work force on the line.\nDefects are not free. Somebody makes them, and gets paid for making them. On the supposition that it costs as much to correct a defect as to make it in the first place, then 42 percent of his payroll and burden was being spent to make defective items and to repair them.\nOnce the manager saw the magnitude of the problem, and saw that he was paying out good money to make defects as well as to correct them, he found ways to improve processes and to help the people on the line to understand better the new operation. The cost of rework went down dramatically in a space of two months.\nNext step: reduce further the proportion defective in a never-ending program of improvement. The cost of rework is only part of the cost of poor quality. Poor quality begets poor quality and lowers productivity all along the line, and some of the faulty product goes out the door, into the hands of the customer. An unhappy customer tells his friends. The multiplying effect of an unhappy customer is one of those unknown and unknowable figures, and likewise for the multiplying effect of a happy customer, who brings in business (see p. 104).\nA. V. Feigenbaum estimated that from 15 to 40 percent of the manufacturer’s costs of almost any American product that you buy today is for waste embedded in it—waste of human effort, waste of machine-time, nonproductive use of accompanying burden.3 No wonder that many American products are hard to sell at home or abroad.\nIn some work that I did for a railway, study showed that mechanics in a huge repair shop spent three-quarters of their time waiting in line to get parts.\nThe reader’s own estimate of the cost of common practices in the United States, such as awarding business to the lowest bidder and robbing people of their right to pride of workmanship (Points 4 and 12 in Ch. 2), would add a deplorable amount to Dr. Feigenbaum’s estimate.\nHandling damage, right in the factory, is in many places appalling, sometimes running from 5 to 8 percent of the manufacturer’s cost. Further loss occurs in transit. Then there is shelf-wear—further loss. Ask any grocer what his losses are from handling damage on his platform, platform to storage shelf, shelf-wear, mauling by curious customers.\n\nNew machinery and gadgets are not the answer\nWe have just seen an example in which important gains in quality and productivity were accomplished by learning to use effectively the machinery on hand.\nLag in American productivity has been attributed in editorials and in letters in the newspapers to failure to install new machinery, gadgets, and the latest types of automation such as robots. Such suggestions make interesting reading and still more interesting writing for people that do not understand problems of production. The following paragraph received from a friend in a large manufacturing company will serve as illustration:\n\nThis whole program [design and installation of new machines] has led to some unhappy experiences. All these wonderful machines performed their intended functions, on test, but when they were put into operation in our plants, with our people, they were out of business so much of the time for this and that kind of failure that our overall costs, instead of going down, went up. No one had evaluated the overall probable failure rates and maintenance. As a result, we were continually caught with stoppages and with not enough spare parts, or with none at all; and no provision for alternate production lines.\nGadgets for automation and automatic recording in the office and in the factory are not the answer either. Exhibitions featuring such gadgets are attended by thousands of people seeking an easy way out of the lag in productivity, trusting hopefully to hardware. Some gadgets may increase productivity enough to pay their own expenses, but the combined effect of new machinery, gadgets, and bright ideas is a small packet compared with the gains in productivity that will be accomplished by the management of companies that survive the decline (Chs. 2 and 3).\nIf I were a banker, I would not lend money for new equipment unless the company that asked for the loan could demonstrate by statistical evidence that they are using their present equipment to reasonably full capacity, and are at work on the 14 points of Chapter 2 and on the deadly diseases and obstacles of Chapter 3.\n\nService industries\n Eventually quality improvement will reach not only the production of goods and food (the birthplace of modern statistical theory was agriculture) but the service industries as well—hotels, restaurants, transportation of freight and passengers, wholesale and retail establishments, hospitals, medical service, care of the aged, perhaps even the U.S. mail.\nIn fact, one of the most successful examples of improvement of quality and productivity in large operations is in our own Census, not only in the decennial Census, but also in the regular monthly and quarterly surveys of people and of business, an example being the Monthly Report on the Labor Force.\nChapter 7 contains a number of examples of improvement of practices in service industries. The section written by William J. Latzko describes methods and results in reduction of errors in a bank. The section written by John F. Hird describes improvements in the purchase, generation, and distribution of electric power to customers, which is one of the most important services of the country. A large power company in the United States, under his guidance, is improving service and cutting costs, with substantial profit, no one working harder, only smarter, from management to linemen and truck drivers (p. 204). (Cf. William G. Hunter, pp. 210ff.)\nSome service industries in Japan have been active in improvement of productivity from the start in 1950—for example, the Japanese National Railways, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, the Tobacco Monopoly of Japan, the Post Office.\nService organizations have won the Deming Prize in Japan; for example, Takenaka Komuten, an architectural and construction firm, won the Deming Prize in 1979. They studied the needs of users (in offices, hospitals, factories, hotels, trains, subways). They reduced by computer the amount and cost of rework in drawings. Research in soils, rocks, movement of earth, machinery, accomplished continual improvement in methods of construction. Kajima Corporation, another architectural and construction firm, won similar recognition in 1982; likewise the Shimizu Construction Company, in 1983. The Kansai Electric Power Company, serving Osaka, Nagoya, and other parts of Central Japan, the biggest power company in the world, won the Deming Prize in 1984.\n\nMeasures of productivity do not lead to improvement in productivity.\nThere is in the United States, any day, a conference on productivity, usually more than one. There is in fact a permanent conference on productivity, and there is now the President’s Committee on Productivity. The aim of these conferences is to construct measures of productivity. It is important to have measures of productivity for meaningful comparisons of productivity in the United States year by year, and for meaningful comparisons between countries. Unfortunately, however, figures on productivity in the United States do not help to improve productivity in the United States. Measures of productivity are like statistics on accidents: they tell you all about the number of accidents in the home, on the road, and at the work place, but they do not tell you how to reduce the frequency of accidents.\nIt is unfortunately to be feared that quality assurance means in many places a deluge of figures that tell how many defective items of this type and that type were produced last month, with comparisons month to month and year to year. Figures like this tell the management how things have been going, but they do not point the way to improvement.\nOne of the lecturers at the meeting of the Bank Administration Institute held in Atlanta in January 1982 advised every bank to establish a productivity office to measure productivity. There are 14,000 banks in the United States. The speaker’s plan would thus create 14,000 jobs. Unfortunately, measurement of productivity does not improve productivity.\nOn the other hand, an orderly study of productivity, to enquire whether any given activity is consistent with the aim of the organization, and what it is costing, can be very helpful to the management. The following paragraphs from Marvin E. Mundel, Measuring and Enhancing the Productivity of Service and Government Organizations (Asian Productivity Organization, Aoyama Pai-ichi Mansions, 4–14 Akasaka 8-chome, Minatoku, Tokyo 107, 1975, pp. 3–4) throw light on this point:\n\nOutputs … cannot be considered without considering the goals they are designed to achieve. …\nIn order to provide some background let us analyze a few examples. Thomas A. Edison, the great American inventor, is said to have proposed a voting machine to improve the voting procedure used by the Congress of the United States. He demonstrated his device to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. With his device each Representative and Senator would have had three buttons on the arm of his chair; a red button for no, a green button for yes and a white button for abstain. Edison proposed that, when the signal to vote was given, each Member would push the appropriate button and both a record of how each voted and the totals of the votes would be displayed instantly. Edison proudly assured the Speaker and the President of the Senate that his device would eliminate roll-call errors, reduce the time for a roll-call vote by an enormous percentage, and so forth.\nHe was utterly astounded when the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate cut him off brusquely and informed him that such a system was utterly unwanted, undesirable and, rather than improving the operation of the House or the Senate, would completely upset the orderly working of the Congress of the United States. What was an improvement from Edison’s point of view was anything but an improvement from the viewpoint of the Congress. The delays in a roll-call vote were an integral part of the deliberative process with which the Congress had chosen to operate. Mr. Edison’s output, a faster vote, was not compatible with the objectives of the Congress.\nAs an example from the private sector, a large shipbuilding firm sought to improve the performance of the group charged with planning and implementing the shiplaunching ceremony party. Initial efforts were directed at the equipment used to send invitations, and so forth. However, questions were raised concerning possible confusion between the party given (the output) and the purpose of the party (the objective).\nThe objective of the party planning group was to improve relations with vendors and government officials of the area. When the output (the party) was initiated it had served this purpose. However, when the frequency changed from one-per-year to almost monthly the parties no longer achieved this purpose; they had become a bore and an imposition.\nRather than improve the method of planning and implementing, the format of the party was changed to include only a small, interested group; the owner, his guests and hosts from the company. Twenty employees in the party-giving group were made available for other work. Other additional savings (temporary seat erecting labor; loss of shipway time) were almost as large. Public relations were improved.\n\nNotes\n1. Taken from the letter from Dr. Tsuda referred to below.\n2. I am indebted to founding members of JUSE for the early history of their efforts: in particular, Dr. E.

Awakening in Japan\nManagement in some companies in Japan observed in 1948 and 1949 that improvement of quality begets naturally and inevitably improvement of productivity. This observation came from the work of a number of Japanese engineers who studied literature on quality control supplied by engineers from the Bell Laboratories then working on General MacArthur’s staff. The literature included Walter A. Shewhart’s book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (Van Nostrand, 1931; repr. ed., American Society for Quality Control, 1980). The results were exciting, showing that productivity does indeed improve as variation is reduced, just as prophesied by the methods and logic of Shewhart’s book. As a result of a foreign expert’s visit in the summer of 1950, the following chain reaction became engraved in Japan as a way of life.2 This chain reaction was on the blackboard of every meeting with top management in Japan from July 1950 onward; also Figure 1.\n \n\nFigure 1 Production viewed as a system.

In a service organization, the sources A, B, C, etc., could be sources of data, or work from preceding operations, such as charges (as in a department store), calculation of charges, deposits, withdrawals, inventories in and out, transcriptions, shipping orders, and the like.\nThe production worker in Japan, as anywhere else in the world, always knew about this chain reaction; also that defects and faults that get into the hands of the customer lose the market and cost him his job.\nOnce management in Japan adopted the chain reaction, everyone there from 1950 onward had one common aim, namely, quality.\nWith no lenders nor stockholders to press for dividends, this effort became an undivided bond between management and production workers. An unfriendly takeover or a leveraged buyout does not take place in Japan. Managers are not sensitive to the price:earnings ratio of their stock.

A simple example\nSome figures taken from experience will illustrate what happens when we improve quality. A schoolboy can understand them. The superintendent in a plant knew that there were problems with a certain production line. His only explanation was that the work force there (24 people) made a lot of mistakes: that if these people did not make mistakes, there would be none.\nThe first step was to get data from inspection and to plot the fraction defective day by day over the past six weeks (Figure 2). This plot (a run chart) showed stable random variation above and below the average. The level of mistakes, and the variation day to day, were accordingly predictable. What does this mean? It means that here is a stable system for production of defective items (Ch. 11). Any substantial improvement must come from action on the system, the responsibility of management. Wishing and pleading and begging the workers to do better was totally futile.\n\nFigure 2 Proportion defective day by day, before and after attempt to construct operational definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not. The proportion defective was 11 percent before, 5 percent after. I express here my indebtedness to David S. Chambers for the privilege to work with him on this example.\nWhat could the management do? The consultants made the suggestion, based on experience, that possibly the people on the job, and the inspector also, did not understand well enough what kind of work is acceptable and what is not.

      "A simple example": "A simple example Some figures taken from experience will illustrate what happens when we improve quality. A schoolboy can understand them. The superintendent in a plant knew that there were problems with a certain production line. His only explanation was that the work force there (24 people) made a lot of mistakes: that if these people did not make mistakes, there would be none.

The superintendent in a plant knew that there were problems with a certain production line. His only explanation was that the work force there (24 people) made a lot of mistakes: that if these people did not make mistakes, there would be none. The first step was to get data from inspection and to plot the fraction defective day by day over the past six weeks (Figure 2). This plot (a run chart) showed stable random variation above and below the average. The level of mistakes, and the variation day to day, were accordingly predictable. What does this mean? It means that here is a stable system for production of defective items (Ch. 11). Any substantial improvement must come from action on the system, the responsibility of management. Wishing and pleading and begging the workers to do better was totally futile. The first step was to get data from inspection and to plot the fraction defective day by day over the past six weeks ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Proportion defective day by day, before and after attempt to construct operational definitions of what is acceptable work and what is not.

Conway, president of the Nashua Corporation:\n\nAt Nashua, the first big success took place in March 1980; improvement of quality and reduction of cost in the manufacture of carbonless paper.\nWater-based coating that contains various chemicals is applied to a moving web of paper. If the amount of coating is right, the customer will be pleased with a good consistent mark when he uses the paper some months later. The coating head applied approximately 3.6 pounds of dry coating to 3000 square feet of paper at a speed of approximately 1100 linear feet per minute on a web 6 or 8 feet wide. Technicians took samples of paper and made tests to determine the intensity of the mark. These tests were made on the sample both as it came off the coater and after it was aged in an oven to simulate use by the customer. When tests showed the intensity of the mark to be too low or too high, the operator made adjustments that would increase or decrease the amount of coating material. Frequent stops for new settings were a way of life. These stops were costly.\nThe engineers knew that the average weight of the coating material was too high, but did not know how to lower it without risk of putting on insufficient coating. A new coating head, to cost $700,000, was under consideration. There would be, besides the cost of $700,000, time lost for installation, and the risk that the new head might not achieve uniformity and economy of coating much better than the equipment in use.\nIn August 1979, the plant manager asked for help. It was found that the coating head, if left untouched, was actually in pretty good statistical control at an average level of 3.6 dry pounds of coating on the paper, plus or minus 0.4.\nElimination of various causes of variation, highlighted by points outside the control limits, reduced the amount of coating and still maintained good consistent quality. The coater had by April 1980 settled down to an average of 2.8 pounds per 3000 square feet, varying from 2.4 to 3.2, thereby saving 0.8 pound per 3000 square feet (3.6–2.8), or $800,000 per year at present volume and cost levels.\n\nIt may be noted that what the people there had been doing was to follow Rule 2 or Rule 3 (p. 282), greatly increasing the variance of the coating, exactly the opposite of what they were trying to do.",

Innovation to improve the process\n The rest of Mr. Conway’s story is still more interesting. Statistical control opened the way to engineering innovation. Without statistical control, the process was in unstable chaos, the noise of which would mask the effect of any attempt to bring improvement. With statistical control achieved, engineers and chemists became innovative, creative. They now had an identifiable process. They modified the chemical content of the material used for the coating and found how to use less and less. Reduction of a tenth of a pound means an annual reduction of $100,000 in the cost of coating.\nThe engineers also improved the coating head, to achieve greater and greater uniformity of coating.

Low quality means high costs\n A plant was plagued by a huge amount of defective product. “How many people have you on this line for rework of defects made in previous operations?” I asked the manager. He went to the blackboard and put down three people here, four there, and so on—in total, 21 percent of the work force on the line.\nDefects are not free. Somebody makes them, and gets paid for making them. On the supposition that it costs as much to correct a defect as to make it in the first place, then 42 percent of his payroll and burden was being spent to make defective items and to repair them.\nOnce the manager saw the magnitude of the problem, and saw that he was paying out good money to make defects as well as to correct them, he found ways to improve processes and to help the people on the line to understand better the new operation. The cost of rework went down dramatically in a space of two months.\nNext step: reduce further the proportion defective in a never-ending program of improvement. The cost of rework is only part of the cost of poor quality. Poor quality begets poor quality and lowers productivity all along the line, and some of the faulty product goes out the door, into the hands of the customer. An unhappy customer tells his friends. The multiplying effect of an unhappy customer is one of those unknown and unknowable figures, and likewise for the multiplying effect of a happy customer, who brings in business (see p. 104).\nA. V. Feigenbaum estimated that from 15 to 40 percent of the manufacturer’s costs of almost any American product that you buy today is for waste embedded in it—waste of human effort, waste of machine-time, nonproductive use of accompanying burden.3 No wonder that many American products are hard to sell at home or abroad.\nIn some work that I did for a railway, study showed that mechanics in a huge repair shop spent three-quarters of their time waiting in line to get parts.\nThe reader’s own estimate of the cost of common practices in the United States, such as awarding business to the lowest bidder and robbing people of their right to pride of workmanship (Points 4 and 12 in Ch. 2), would add a deplorable amount to Dr. Feigenbaum’s estimate.\nHandling damage, right in the factory, is in many places appalling, sometimes running from 5 to 8 percent of the manufacturer’s cost.

As a result, we were continually caught with stoppages and with not enough spare parts, or with none at all; and no provision for alternate production lines. This whole program [design and installation of new machines] has led to some unhappy experiences.

As a result, we were continually caught with stoppages and with not enough spare parts, or with none at all; and no provision for alternate production lines. Gadgets for automation and automatic recording in the office and in the factory are not the answer either. Exhibitions featuring such gadgets are attended by thousands of people seeking an easy way out of the lag in productivity, trusting hopefully to hardware. Some gadgets may increase productivity enough to pay their own expenses, but the combined effect of new machinery, gadgets, and bright ideas is a small packet compared with the gains in productivity that will be accomplished by the management of companies that survive the decline (Chs. 2 and 3). If I were a banker, I would not lend money for new equipment unless the company that asked for the loan could demonstrate by statistical evidence that they are using their present equipment to reasonably full capacity, and are at work on the 14 points of Chapter 2 and on the deadly diseases and obstacles of Chapter 3. Service industries\n Eventually quality improvement will reach not only the production of goods and food (the birthplace of modern statistical theory was agriculture) but the service industries as well—hotels, restaurants, transportation of freight and passengers, wholesale and retail establishments, hospitals, medical service, care of the aged, perhaps even the U.S. mail.\nIn fact, one of the most successful examples of improvement of quality and productivity in large operations is in our own Census, not only in the decennial Census, but also in the regular monthly and quarterly surveys of people and of business, an example being the Monthly Report on the Labor Force.\nChapter 7 contains a number of examples of improvement of practices in service industries. The section written by William J. Latzko describes methods and results in reduction of errors in a bank. The section written by John F. Hird describes improvements in the purchase, generation, and distribution of electric power to customers, which is one of the most important services of the country. A large power company in the United States, under his guidance, is improving service and cutting costs, with substantial profit, no one working harder, only smarter, from management to linemen and truck drivers (p. 204). (Cf. William G. Hunter, pp. 210ff.)\nSome service industries in Japan have been active in improvement of productivity from the start in 1950—for example, the Japanese National Railways, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, the Tobacco Monopoly of Japan, the Post Office.\nService organizations have won the Deming Prize in Japan; for example, Takenaka Komuten, an architectural and construction firm, won the Deming Prize in 1979. They studied the needs of users (in offices, hospitals, factories, hotels, trains, subways). They reduced by computer the amount and cost of rework in drawings. Research in soils, rocks, movement of earth, machinery, accomplished continual improvement in methods of construction. Kajima Corporation, another architectural and construction firm, won similar recognition in 1982; likewise the Shimizu Construction Company, in 1983.

Measures of productivity do not lead to improvement in productivity.\nThere is in the United States, any day, a conference on productivity, usually more than one. There is in fact a permanent conference on productivity, and there is now the President’s Committee on Productivity. The aim of these conferences is to construct measures of productivity. It is important to have measures of productivity for meaningful comparisons of productivity in the United States year by year, and for meaningful comparisons between countries. Unfortunately, however, figures on productivity in the United States do not help to improve productivity in the United States. Measures of productivity are like statistics on accidents: they tell you all about the number of accidents in the home, on the road, and at the work place, but they do not tell you how to reduce the frequency of accidents.\nIt is unfortunately to be feared that quality assurance means in many places a deluge of figures that tell how many defective items of this type and that type were produced last month, with comparisons month to month and year to year. Figures like this tell the management how things have been going, but they do not point the way to improvement.\nOne of the lecturers at the meeting of the Bank Administration Institute held in Atlanta in January 1982 advised every bank to establish a productivity office to measure productivity. There are 14,000 banks in the United States. The speaker’s plan would thus create 14,000 jobs. Unfortunately, measurement of productivity does not improve productivity.\nOn the other hand, an orderly study of productivity, to enquire whether any given activity is consistent with the aim of the organization, and what it is costing, can be very helpful to the management. The following paragraphs from Marvin E. Mundel, Measuring and Enhancing the Productivity of Service and Government Organizations (Asian Productivity Organization, Aoyama Pai-ichi Mansions, 4–14 Akasaka 8-chome, Minatoku, Tokyo 107, 1975, pp. 3–4) throw light on this point:\n\nOutputs … cannot be considered without considering the goals they are designed to achieve. …\nIn order to provide some background let us analyze a few examples. Thomas A. Edison, the great American inventor, is said to have proposed a voting machine to improve the voting procedure used by the Congress of the United States. He demonstrated his device to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. With his device each Representative and Senator would have had three buttons on the arm of his chair; a red button for no, a green button for yes and a white button for abstain. Edison proposed that, when the signal to vote was given, each Member would push the appropriate button and both a record of how each voted and the totals of the votes would be displayed instantly. Edison proudly assured the Speaker and the President of the Senate that his device would eliminate roll-call errors, reduce the time for a roll-call vote by an enormous percentage, and so forth.\nHe was utterly astounded when the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate cut him off brusquely and informed him that such a system was utterly unwanted, undesirable and, rather than improving the operation of the House or the Senate, would completely upset the orderly working of the Congress of the United States. What was an improvement from Edison’s point of view was anything but an improvement from the viewpoint of the Congress. The delays in a roll-call vote were an integral part of the deliberative process with which the Congress had chosen to operate. Mr. Edison’s output, a faster vote, was not compatible with the objectives of the Congress.\nAs an example from the private sector, a large shipbuilding firm sought to improve the performance of the group charged with planning and implementing the shiplaunching ceremony party. Initial efforts were directed at the equipment used to send invitations, and so forth. However, questions were raised concerning possible confusion between the party given (the output) and the purpose of the party (the objective).\nThe objective of the party planning group was to improve relations with vendors and government officials of the area. When the output (the party) was initiated it had served this purpose. However, when the frequency changed from one-per-year to almost monthly the parties no longer achieved this purpose; they had become a bore and an imposition.\nRather than improve the method of planning and implementing, the format of the party was changed to include only a small, interested group; the owner, his guests and hosts from the company. Twenty employees in the party-giving group were made available for other work. Other additional savings (temporary seat erecting labor; loss of shipway time) were almost as large. Public relations were improved.\n\nNotes\n1. Taken from the letter from Dr. Tsuda referred to below.\n2. I am indebted to founding members of JUSE for the early history of their efforts: in particular, Dr. E.
